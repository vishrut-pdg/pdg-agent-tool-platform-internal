# Craft Search Tool — Design & Rationale

> Related: [search-requirements.md](search-requirements.md)

## Overview

This document defines the design for replacing Craft's legacy `files/` corpus sync with a first-party search tool. The high-level requirements live in `search-requirements.md`; this document records the approach we chose, why we chose it over alternatives, and the objectives and requirements for each subproject.

The implementation has four parts:

1. **Agent-First CLI Refactor** — Reposition onyx-cli as an agent experience (AX) tool.
2. **Search API** — A new backend endpoint exposing the full Onyx chat-mode search pipeline.
3. **CLI Search Command** — New onyx-cli command(s) wrapping the search API, plus a rationalized agent tool surface.
4. **Craft Integration** — Wire onyx-cli into the Craft sandbox, replacing file sync entirely.

The end state: a Craft agent calls onyx-cli inside its sandbox to search company knowledge, hitting the same search pipeline (query expansion, hybrid retrieval, LLM document selection, context expansion) that powers Onyx chat. The agent gets permissioned, fresh, citation-rich results scoped to the running user — no corpus dump, no drift, no separate retrieval story.

---

## Approaches Considered

We evaluated three delivery mechanisms for giving the Craft sandbox access to Onyx search: MCP, an independent skill script, and the CLI. Each was assessed against the core requirement from `search-requirements.md`: **behavioral parity with the chat flow's search tool**.

### A. Onyx MCP Server (rejected)

The Onyx MCP server is already configured to handle authentication and search requests. OpenCode can act as an MCP client, so in principle the sandbox could call the existing MCP search tool with no new backend work.

**Why rejected — not parity with chat-mode search:**

The MCP server uses the EE `send_search_query` endpoint, which provides parity with Onyx's **Search Mode**, not the **Chat Mode** search tool. The gap is significant:

- **No semantic query rephrase.** Chat-mode search runs `semantic_query_rephrase()` to produce a standalone reformulation of the query using conversation context. Search Mode skips this.
- **Different query expansion logic.** Chat-mode search runs parallel semantic + keyword expansion with distinct weighting (`LLM_SEMANTIC_QUERY_WEIGHT=1.3`, `LLM_KEYWORD_QUERY_WEIGHT=1.0`). Search Mode has its own, simpler expansion.
- **No LLM context expansion.** Chat-mode search classifies each selected document's relevance and expands context by including adjacent chunks (up to full-document retrieval). Search Mode returns chunks as-is.
- **No federated search.** Chat-mode search runs federated retrieval (Slack, etc.) in parallel with Vespa queries. Search Mode does not.
- **Different query weighting.** Chat-mode search uses weighted reciprocal rank fusion across multiple query groups with different hybrid alpha values. Search Mode uses simpler ranking.

The MCP path would have been the easiest to implement, but it delivers a materially worse search experience. The whole point of this project is that the Craft agent should get the same retrieval quality as a user in chat — "if chat search gets better, Craft search gets better for free." The MCP path doesn't achieve that.

### B. Independent Skill Script (viable but limited)

A standalone skill (a shell script calling `curl`) as described in the earlier `search-requirements.md` approach. Very lightweight: a `run.sh` that POSTs to a backend endpoint and prints results to stdout.

**Pros:**
- Minimal implementation surface. A shell script and a new endpoint.
- No dependency on the CLI codebase.

**Cons:**
- Craft-only. The skill script lives in the sandbox image and benefits no one else.
- No path to broader agent tooling. Other agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) can't reuse the script.
- Requires a custom auth mechanism (sandbox token) rather than using the existing PAT system.
- Dead-end: if Craft needs more Onyx capabilities later (list connectors, create agents, manage personas), each requires a new bespoke script.

### C. Onyx CLI (chosen)

Bundle onyx-cli into the sandbox. Add a `search` command backed by a new general-purpose search API. Authenticate via PAT.

**Pros:**
- **Anything implemented for Craft immediately benefits all other agents.** Claude Code users, Cursor users, custom integrations — everyone gets the same search command.
- **Extensible.** If Craft later needs more Onyx capabilities (manage agents, configure connectors, "Onyx-management via Craft"), they're CLI commands, not bespoke scripts.
- **Uses existing auth.** PATs already work. No new token type.
- **The CLI already exists** and has infrastructure for non-interactive use (`ask` command, `--json` output, exit codes).

**Cons:**
- Requires CLI refactoring work (Part 1) to make it properly agent-first.
- Requires a new backend search API (Part 2) — but this is needed regardless of delivery mechanism.
- Sandbox image grows by the size of the Go binary.
- Craft sandbox needs internal network URL (`ONYX_SERVER_URL` pointing at the Kube service, not the public nginx URL).

**Why this wins:**

The CLI is the only option where investment compounds. A skill script is throwaway. The MCP server doesn't have the right search pipeline. The CLI becomes the universal agent interface to Onyx — search, ask, discover, and (eventually) manage. Every Craft improvement lands for every agent.

### Decision: Results, Not Answers

The search API returns retrieved documents with citations — not an LLM-generated answer. This is deliberate:

- **If the search is for the user**, passing back an LLM-generated answer is "deep frying" — the agent will process the answer again to incorporate it into its own response. The user gets double-processed text for no reason.
- **If the search is for the agent**, returning results gives the agent more options. It can synthesize across multiple searches, decide which results matter, and cite sources directly. An LLM answer forecloses those options.
- **User-facing agents decide what to do with search results.** Fewer options if given a pre-digested answer.
- The existing `ask` command already provides the "give me an LLM answer" path. `search` is the complementary primitive: retrieval without generation.

### Note: LLM-Facing Output Format

`search-requirements.md` describes the search output as "a single markdown blob to stdout." The actual `SearchTool` implementation (`convert_inference_sections_to_llm_string()`) produces a JSON string — `json.dumps({"results": [...]})` with fields like `document` (citation ID), `title`, `content`, `source_type`. This is what chat-flow LLM consumers already see. We use the same JSON format for consistency: the search API returns it as `llm_facing_text`, and the CLI prints it to stdout by default. The requirements doc is preserved as-is for historical reference.

### Consumer Note: Onyx MCP Server

The new search API (Part 2) should also become the backend for the Onyx MCP server's search tool. The MCP server currently calls the EE `send_search_query` endpoint (Search Mode parity). Once the chat-mode search API exists, the MCP server should switch to it — giving MCP consumers the same search quality upgrade. This is out of scope for this project but is a direct beneficiary.

---

## Part 1: Agent-First CLI Refactor (COMPLETE)

> **Status: Implemented.** Part 1 introduced several patterns that Parts 2-4 should be aware of:
> - **IOStreams abstraction** — All command output flows through an `IOStreams` struct (Stdout/Stderr writers, IsInteractive flag, MaxOutput limit). New commands should accept `IOStreams` rather than writing to `os.Stdout` directly.
> - **Relative URL paths** — API client methods use relative paths (e.g., `"/chat/send-message-simple-api"`), not absolute URLs. The base URL is joined at request time.
> - **Shared command helpers** — Common patterns (output formatting, error handling, JSON marshaling, TTY gating) are factored into helper functions under `cli/cmd/`. New commands should reuse these rather than reimplementing.
> - **Python integration tests** — CLI integration tests live in `cli/tests/` and are written in Python (pytest). They invoke the compiled binary as a subprocess and assert on stdout, stderr, and exit codes. Parts 2-4 should follow this pattern.

### Objective

Reposition onyx-cli from a human-first TUI that has a non-interactive sidecar (`ask`) into an **agent experience (AX) tool** — a CLI designed first for agent consumption, with the TUI as an extension for human users.

This is not "add an agent mode." This is: onyx-cli is, by default, an agent's interface to Onyx knowledge and capabilities. The TUI and interactive configuration are gated behind a TTY. Agents without a TTY get the core tool surface — searching knowledge, getting answers, discovering what's available — with structured output, clean exit codes, and no prompts. If we want a richer human-facing CLI/TUI experience beyond what TTY-gating provides, that becomes an extension or a separate CLI. The agent path is the main path.

### Requirements

#### R1.1: Non-interactive by default without TTY

When stdin is not a TTY (the universal signal for "an agent or script is calling me"), the CLI must never:
- Launch the Bubble Tea TUI or any interactive UI
- Prompt for input (configuration, confirmation, or otherwise)
- Block waiting for user interaction
- Produce output that assumes a terminal (ANSI escape codes, cursor movement, spinners)

When stdin IS a TTY, current interactive behavior is preserved.

#### R1.2: Agent-optimized default output

Non-interactive mode output must be optimized for LLM consumption:
- Default output format is markdown (readable by agents, parseable, citation-friendly)
- `--json` flag switches to structured JSON (for programmatic consumers)
- `--quiet` flag suppresses progress/status output (already exists on `ask`)
- Progress and status information goes to stderr; results go to stdout (clean pipe separation)
- Non-TTY output is truncated to 50000 bytes with the full response saved to a temp file. This is intentional — coding agents have tool call output limits, and the temp file path lets the agent read more if needed. The `--max-output` flag provides an override.

#### R1.3: Configuration isolation

Agents must not be able to configure the CLI — they cannot set the Onyx URL, API key, or any other persistent setting. Configuration is a human operation:

- The `configure` command is gated behind interactive mode (requires TTY). Without a TTY, it fails with a clear error.
- Inside Craft sandboxes, the CLI is configured entirely via environment variables (`ONYX_SERVER_URL`, `ONYX_PAT`). No config file is created, read, or needed.
- The `validate-config` command remains available in non-interactive mode (read-only, useful for health checks).
- Outside of Craft (e.g., a developer using onyx-cli with Claude Code), the config file works as it does today.

#### R1.4: Clean command surface for agents

Agents can see all CLI commands, but human-only commands are gated behind the TUI (no TTY = not usable):

- **Agent-usable commands** (available without TTY): commands for searching knowledge, getting LLM answers, listing agents/personas, and validating configuration. The exact command names and whether search and answer are one command or two is an implementation decision (see Part 3).
- **Human-only commands** (require TTY): the TUI, interactive configuration, SSH server, session browser.
- **Setup commands** (one-time, not for agents): skill installation for agent harnesses.
- Invoking a human-only command without a TTY produces a clear error, not a hang or crash.

#### R1.5: Exit codes are the error contract

Agents use both exit codes and error messages. Exit codes tell the agent (and scripts) that something failed; the stderr error message tells the agent *what* failed and *what to do about it*. Both matter:

- The exit code set is: `Success=0`, `General=1`, `BadRequest=2`, `NotConfigured=3`, `AuthFailure=4`, `Unreachable=5`, `RateLimited=6`, `Timeout=7`, `ServerError=8`, `NotAvailable=9`.
- Every non-zero exit must print a clear, actionable error message to stderr — not just an error code or generic "request failed." The message should help an agent understand the problem and either fix it or ask the user for help (e.g., `"authentication failed: PAT expired, ask the user to generate a new one"`).

#### R1.6: Version and capability discovery

The CLI should support a machine-readable health check so that agents (or Craft session setup) can verify:
- CLI version
- Backend version and reachability
- Available authentication (is a PAT configured? does it have valid permissions?)

This supports Part 4's need to validate the CLI is properly configured at session start.

#### R1.7: SKILL.md and README updates

The CLI's `install-skill` command installs a `SKILL.md` for agent harnesses (Claude Code, etc.). This SKILL.md and the CLI's README must be updated to reflect the new agent-first positioning: search as a primary command, the rationalized command surface, structured output options, and the fact that the CLI is designed for agent use.

### Key Challenges

- **Breaking change for existing CLI users**: This refactor will break existing onyx-cli workflows. Developers who use it interactively today will see different default behavior. Backwards compatibility is not a design constraint — we are not preserving the old UX — but be aware this is a breaking change and documentation/changelog should call it out.
- **Output format**: Agents consume the default plain-text stdout. The existing `--json` flag (NDJSON stream events) is left unchanged — it serves programmatic consumers, not agents.

---

## Part 2: Search API (COMPLETE)

> **Status: Implemented.** Key implementation details for Parts 3-4:
> - **Endpoint** — `POST /api/search`, routed through `backend/onyx/server/features/search/api.py` with request/response models in `models.py`.
> - **NullEmitter** — `SearchTool` requires an `Emitter`; a no-op `NullEmitter` in `backend/onyx/chat/emitter.py` satisfies this for non-chat callers.
> - **Integration tests** — `backend/tests/integration/tests/search/test_search_api.py`.
> - **`message_history` support** — Added beyond the original plan. Callers with conversation context can pass it in for better query expansion (resolves pronouns, follow-ups, etc.).
> - **Field naming** — LLM override fields use `provider`/`model`, consistent with the rest of the API surface.
>
> ⚠️ **The request/response examples in the Part 2 subsections below describe the original design and are stale.** The shipped contract dropped `num_results`, `time_cutoff_days`, `chunk_ind`, `blurb`, `score`, `llm_facing_text`, and `citation_mapping`; `content` (full chunk for LLM-selected docs, blurb fallback) is the single content field; only LLM-selected docs are returned. See `backend/onyx/server/features/search/models.py` for the authoritative shapes.

### Objective

Create a new backend API endpoint that exposes Onyx's full hybrid search pipeline — the same pipeline that powers the chat flow's `SearchTool` — as a standalone, authenticated endpoint. It returns ranked, permissioned search results without generating an LLM answer.

The API must invoke `SearchTool.run()` exactly as the chat flow does: query expansion, multi-query hybrid retrieval, weighted RRF fusion, LLM document selection, and context expansion. This is behavioral parity — the same search quality a user gets in chat, available programmatically.

This API is general-purpose. Its consumers include onyx-cli (Part 3), the Craft sandbox (Part 4), and — in the future — the Onyx MCP server (replacing its current Search Mode backend).

### Requirements

#### R2.1: Exact search pipeline parity

The endpoint must instantiate `SearchTool` and call `.run()` — the same code path `tool_constructor.py` uses for chat. This means:
- LLM-powered query expansion (semantic rephrase + keyword expansion)
- Multi-query hybrid retrieval against Vespa
- Weighted reciprocal rank fusion across query results
- LLM-powered document selection (top-N relevance filtering)
- LLM-powered context expansion (adjacent chunk inclusion)
- Federated source retrieval (Slack, etc.) where configured

The endpoint is NOT a simplified "just search Vespa" shortcut. It is the full intelligent retrieval pipeline. The LLM calls inside the pipeline use the deployment's default LLM (or an optionally specified one).

#### R2.2: Interface design — layered configuration

The interface is the hardest part of this subproject. It must be a complete, usable primitive for agents while still allowing high configuration for power users and integrations.

**Simple case (agents, most calls):** Just a query string. Everything else uses sensible defaults.
```
POST /api/search { "query": "what's the sales process for enterprise?" }
```

**Filtered case (power users, targeted searches):** Query plus source and time filters.
```
POST /api/search { "query": "...", "sources": ["slack", "google_drive"], "time_cutoff_days": 30 }
```

**Advanced case (integrations, automation):** Full control over search behavior.
```
POST /api/search {
  "query": "...",
  "sources": ["slack"],
  "document_sets": ["engineering-docs"],
  "tags": [...],
  "time_cutoff_days": 90,
  "persona_id": 5,
  "num_results": 20,
  "skip_query_expansion": false,
  "skip_document_selection": false,
  "max_context_chunks": 15
}
```

The design principle: every parameter beyond `query` is optional with a good default. The defaults should produce the same quality results as a chat search with no user-selected filters. Advanced parameters expose the knobs that exist internally without inventing new ones.

**Knob exposure:** The search pipeline has many configurable parameters — retrieval balance, result counts, query expansion behavior, recency weighting, source/document-set filters, persona scoping, message history for context, and more. Agents are good at iterating: they run a search, read results, reason about what's wrong, and adjust on the next call. The implementation plan for this part should audit all per-query knobs in the search pipeline, determine which are meaningful to expose, and design how they map to API parameters. The goal is that an agent can progressively refine searches without needing a settings echo — it infers what to change from the results.

Key interface decisions that need resolution:
- **Persona scoping**: Should `persona_id` be a parameter? Personas define document set filters, search start dates, and attached documents. Exposing this gives the API access to admin-configured "search profiles" without re-specifying all their settings. But it also couples the search API to persona configuration.
- **LLM selection**: The search pipeline uses an LLM for query expansion and document selection. What LLM does the API use? Options: the deployment's default, a request-specified model, or a dedicated "search LLM" configuration. The simplest is the deployment's default.
- **Query expansion control**: `skip_query_expansion` and `skip_document_selection` let callers trade quality for speed/cost. These are internal SearchTool knobs that exist today. Should they be exposed?
- **Message history**: The chat flow passes message history to the query expander for context, which significantly improves query expansion (e.g., resolving pronouns, understanding follow-up questions). The search API should accept an optional `message_history` parameter so callers with conversation context can pass it in. Without it, the query must be self-contained — which is fine for most agent use. This may be more work than we want for V1 since it requires defining a message format in the API contract and threading it through to the query expander; if so, defer it, but it's worth considering because it's the main quality gap between chat search and standalone search.

#### R2.3: Response format — structured + LLM-facing

The response includes both structured data (for programmatic consumers) and an LLM-facing text blob (for agents):

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "citation_id": 1,
      "document_id": "google_drive__abc123",
      "chunk_ind": 4,
      "title": "Enterprise Sales Playbook",
      "blurb": "...",
      "content": "...",
      "link": "https://docs.google.com/...",
      "source_type": "google_drive",
      "score": 0.78,
      "updated_at": "2026-03-12T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "llm_facing_text": "{\"results\": [{\"document\": 1, \"title\": \"Enterprise Sales Playbook\", \"source_type\": \"google_drive\", \"content\": \"...\"}]}",
  "citation_mapping": { "1": "google_drive__abc123" },
  "query_expansion": {
    "semantic_queries": ["..."],
    "keyword_queries": ["..."]
  }
}
```

- `results`: The full ranked result set with all metadata. Derived from `SearchDocsResponse.search_docs` / `displayed_docs`.
- `llm_facing_text`: The same citation-rich JSON string that `SearchTool` produces as its `llm_facing_response` — a `{"results": [...]}` object where each result has fields like `document` (citation ID), `title`, `content`, `source_type`, etc. Ready to paste into an LLM context window.
- `citation_mapping`: Maps citation numbers to document IDs, matching the chat tool's behavior.
- `query_expansion`: What queries the LLM expanded the original into. Useful for debugging and transparency.

#### R2.4: Authentication — PAT-based

The endpoint authenticates via the existing PAT system (`Authorization: Bearer onyx_pat_...`). The PAT resolves to a user; the search runs with that user's permissions (ACLs, tenant). This is the same auth mechanism onyx-cli already uses for all other endpoints. The Craft sandbox gets a session-scoped PAT (Part 4) that is just a regular PAT minted and revoked by the session lifecycle.

No new auth mechanism is needed.

#### R2.5: Permissioning and tenant isolation

The search must run as the authenticated user with full ACL enforcement:
- `build_access_filters_for_user()` determines what documents the user can see
- `CURRENT_TENANT_ID` is set from the user's tenant before any search operations
- Cross-tenant document leakage is a security boundary — this must be tested explicitly

#### R2.6: Rate limiting (deferred from V1)

The core chat flow does not have per-request rate limiting on search — only token-budget rate limiting across chat sessions. Agents iterating through multiple searches to refine results is expected behavior, not abuse. For V1, the PAT already scopes access to a single user, and Craft sessions are sandboxed. Rate limiting can be added later if usage patterns warrant it.

#### R2.7: Endpoint placement

The search endpoint lives under `/api/search` (not `/api/build/...` or `/api/chat/...`). It is a general-purpose Onyx API, not a Craft-specific or chat-specific endpoint. Any authenticated client — onyx-cli, MCP server, integrations, Craft sandbox — can call it.

### Key Challenges

- **Interface design**: Balancing simplicity for the common case with configurability for advanced use. Too few parameters and power users can't express what they need. Too many and agents send garbage.
- **LLM cost**: Every search request triggers LLM calls (query expansion + document selection + context expansion). This is the right tradeoff for quality, but the cost should be visible. Rate limiting is deferred from V1 (see R2.6).
- **SearchTool coupling**: `SearchTool` was built for the chat flow. It requires an `Emitter` (for streaming search progress to the chat UI), message history, user memory context, etc. The API must construct a SearchTool with sensible substitutes for chat-specific dependencies.
- **No conversation context**: Chat search benefits from message history for query expansion context. The API has no conversation. Query expansion still works — it just operates on the query alone, which is how most search APIs work.

---

## Part 3: CLI Search Command & Agent Tool Surface (COMPLETE)

> **Status: Implemented.** Key implementation details for Part 4:
> - **Two commands** — Resolved as separate `search` and `ask` commands. `search` returns retrieved documents with citations; `ask` returns LLM-generated answers. Different backends, different output shapes and cost profiles.
> - **Flags** — `--source` (comma-separated source filter), `--days` (recency cutoff, converted to an ISO timestamp client-side and sent as `time_cutoff`), `--agent-id` (persona/agent scoping), `--no-query-expansion` (skip LLM expansion), `--raw` (full API response instead of the lean projection). No per-call result-count knob; `/api/search` runs the chat-flow-equivalent pool (50 hits → ≤25 chunks).
> - **Default output** — `onyx-cli search` prints a lean projection — `{"results": [{title, url, source_type, content, updated_at}, ...]}` — to stdout. Results contain only documents the LLM judged relevant, ordered by relevance; `content` is the full chunk text of each (the server populates `content` directly on each `SearchResult`, so consumers never fall back). Non-TTY output is truncated to 50000 bytes with a temp file for overflow.
> - **60s timeout** — `Client.Search` uses a dedicated `searchHTTPClient` with a 60s timeout. The search path runs LLM query expansion + relevance selection but does not generate a full answer, so it doesn't need the 5-minute long-timeout client; 60s is the right middle ground for two short LLM calls.

### Objective

Wrap the Part 2 search API in a CLI command (or commands) and rationalize the full CLI into a final set of tools and options for agents. The result is a CLI that an AI agent can use as its primary interface to Onyx — searching knowledge, getting answers, and discovering what's available.

### Requirements

#### R3.1: CLI access to the search API

The CLI must expose the Part 2 search API's full capabilities through command-line flags. At minimum:
- A query string (the only required input)
- Source type filtering
- Time cutoff filtering
- Result count limiting
- Persona scoping
- Structured JSON output as an alternative to the default
- Controls for skipping LLM query expansion / document selection (trade quality for speed/cost)

#### R3.2: Command design — two commands

Two separate commands: `search` for retrieved results and `ask` for LLM-generated answers. They have different backends (search API vs chat endpoint), different output shapes, and different cost profiles. `ask` already existed; `search` is the new primitive that returns retrieval without generation.

#### R3.3: Default output is LLM-facing JSON

When not in JSON mode, the command prints the `llm_facing_text` from the API response to stdout. This is a JSON string containing citation-tagged search results (with document IDs, titles, content, source types, etc.) that an agent can directly consume and cite from. Progress/status goes to stderr.

In JSON mode, the command prints the full structured API response.

#### R3.4: Rationalized command set for agents

The CLI should have a clear, final set of agent-usable commands. All agent-usable commands must share:
- Structured JSON output option
- Clean exit codes for every failure mode
- No interactive prompts
- Stderr for progress, stdout for results
- `--help` that describes the command in a way an LLM can read

Existing commands should be reviewed for consistency with the new search command(s) — flag naming, output format, error format, and truncation behavior should be uniform across the agent-usable surface.

#### R3.5: Persona/agent scoping

Persona scoping is exposed as `--agent-id` on the `search` command. When specified, the search inherits the persona's configured document set filters, search start date, and attached documents. No standalone discovery command — agents learn about available personas from the `company-search` SKILL.md or from the user.

### Key Challenges

- **Command structure**: The search/ask split is a UX decision that affects how agents discover and use the CLI. The implementation plan must justify the chosen structure.
- **Flag design**: Flags must map cleanly to the API's parameters while being intuitive on the command line.
- **Output format stability**: Agents will parse this output. The LLM-facing JSON format must be stable. The full structured JSON response must be a documented, versioned contract.
- **Consistency across commands**: All agent-usable commands should feel like they're from the same tool.

---

## Part 4: Craft Integration

### Objective

Wire onyx-cli into the Craft sandbox as the primary search tool, replacing the legacy `files/` corpus sync entirely. This requires: provisioning per-user PATs with encrypted-at-rest storage, bundling the CLI binary, creating a CLI skill with the user's available sources, and tearing down the file sync infrastructure.

> **Architecture summary.** Dynamic skill content (the rendered `company-search` SKILL.md) is written to the pod via a `write_sandbox_file()` / `render_company_search_skill()` pattern that is decoupled from the sandbox manager interface. Content is rendered in `sandbox/skills/rendering.py`, written to `/workspace/skills/` at the pod level (shared across sessions via existing symlinks), and orchestrated by `SessionManager.push_dynamic_skills()`. This avoids threading new parameters through the manager abstraction and provides a clean extension point for future skill bundles.

### Requirements

#### R4.1: Per-user PAT lifecycle

> **Revised from initial design.** The original design specified per-session PATs minted and revoked with each session. During implementation planning, this was changed to per-user PATs stored encrypted at rest — eliminating ~100x PAT row accumulation and all session lifecycle complexity. See [4-craft-search-proposal.md](4-craft-search-proposal.md) for the full rationale.

Each user's Craft sandbox gets a single PAT that persists across sessions and pod restarts. The PAT is stored encrypted on the `Sandbox` row and injected as a pod-level env var at provisioning time.

- **One PAT per user**, distinguished by a `PatType` enum (`USER`, `CRAFT`) column on `PersonalAccessToken`. The enum uses `name == value` (uppercase), consistent with `AccountType` and `ProcessingMode`. The `server_default` backfills existing rows as `USER` automatically. No name-prefix conventions.
- **Stored encrypted** on the `Sandbox` row using the existing `EncryptedString` column type (same infrastructure as LLM API keys, connector credentials, OAuth tokens). Decrypted at pod provisioning time. This is necessary because PATs are hashed (SHA256) in the `personal_access_token` table — the raw token can't be recovered from the hash, but the sandbox needs it re-injected on every pod provisioning.
- **Injected as a pod-level env var** (`ONYX_PAT`) in the K8s pod spec at provisioning time. All sessions in the pod inherit it automatically — no per-session token injection or shared files. `ONYX_SERVER_URL` points at the internal Kube service address (configured via `SANDBOX_API_SERVER_URL`, no default — must be set per deployment).
- **30-day expiry** as a safety net. At each pod provisioning, `ensure_sandbox_pat()` checks if the stored PAT is still valid. If expired (user was away for 30+ days), it mints a new one. No proactive rotation, no revocation on sleep or termination — pods don't live long enough for the PAT to expire mid-session (1-hour idle timeout << 30-day expiry).
- **Hidden from user's PAT list and protected from deletion.** `GET /user/pats` and `DELETE /user/pats/{id}` filter by `PatType.USER` at the DB query layer so CRAFT PATs are invisible and unrevocable through the user-facing API. `create_pat()` and `revoke_pat()` flush (not commit) — callers own the transaction boundary.
- **Future-compatible with egress proxy.** The `encrypted_pat` column is the single source of truth. Today it's read at pod provisioning and set as an env var. When the egress interception proxy ships (Craft V1 project #4), the proxy reads from the same column and injects credentials server-side — the env var goes away, the sandbox never sees the raw token, and the DB storage is unchanged.

The security boundary is the pod, which is already one-per-user. Per-session PATs don't add security within the same pod. PAT scopes will be addressed later by the Permissions system, not this project.

#### R4.2: CLI binary bundling

The onyx-cli binary must be available inside the sandbox:

- The binary is included in the sandbox Docker image. This is a build-time dependency, not a runtime download.
- The binary version is pinned to the Onyx release. There is no version mismatch between the CLI and the backend it talks to.
- The binary is on `$PATH` inside the sandbox so the agent can invoke it as `onyx-cli` without a full path.
- The binary works without a config file — it reads `ONYX_PAT` and `ONYX_SERVER_URL` from the environment (per Part 1's agent-first design). No `configure` step is needed or possible.

#### R4.3: CLI skill creation

The search tool is exposed to the agent as a skill (following the existing skills system described in `docs/craft/features/skills/skills.md`). The skill consists of:

- **`SKILL.md.template`**: A template that describes how to use onyx-cli search, rendered at session setup with the user's available sources. This is a built-in skill registered with the `BuiltinSkillRegistry`.
- **Skill name**: `company-search` (consistent with `search-requirements.md` — reads naturally, brand-neutral).
- **Rendered `SKILL.md`**: At session setup, the backend queries the user's accessible connectors and renders a SKILL.md that tells the agent:
  - What the search tool is and what it does
  - What sources are available (specific to this user's permissions)
  - Usage examples with the CLI flags
  - Output format description
  - What to do when a source they expect isn't listed

The skill does NOT include a shell script wrapper. The agent calls onyx-cli directly — the CLI is the tool, not a wrapper around curl.

> **Implementation note.** The rendered SKILL.md is written to the **pod-level** `/workspace/skills/` directory, not per-session. The pod is per-user, so all sessions share the same rendered skills via existing symlinks (K8s) or symlinks (local). No migration is needed — the existing delivery mechanism works as-is.
>
> The rendering and writing are decoupled from the session manager interface:
>
> - **`render_company_search_skill(db_session, user, skills_dir) -> RenderedSkillFile`** in `sandbox/skills/rendering.py` renders the company-search skill template and returns a `RenderedSkillFile` (a NamedTuple with `path` and `content` fields). Raises `FileNotFoundError` if the template is missing. `skills_dir` comes from the `SKILLS_TEMPLATE_PATH` config constant.
> - **`write_sandbox_file(sandbox_id, path, content)`** on `SandboxManager` writes to `/workspace/{path}` on the pod. Generic method for pushing any dynamic content. K8s implementation uses `kubectl exec` + `printf`; local uses `Path.write_text`.
> - **`SessionManager.push_dynamic_skills()`** orchestrates: calls `render_company_search_skill()` then `write_sandbox_file()` with the result. Catches all exceptions and logs a warning so skill rendering failures don't block session setup. Called after `setup_session_workspace()` in both `create_session__no_commit()` and the restore path in `sessions_api.py`.
>
> This means `company_search_skill_md` is NOT passed through `setup_session_workspace()` or `restore_snapshot()`. The rendering is fully decoupled from the manager interface — no parameter threading through the sandbox manager abstraction.
>
> **Future direction:** The current push-based `write_sandbox_file()` approach is a stepping stone. Eventually a full skill system will handle multi-file skill bundles. `render_company_search_skill()` handles the company-search template today; adding new skills would mean adding new rendering functions or generalizing the pattern.

#### R4.4: Available sources injection

The skill's source list is populated from the user's actual connector access:

- Source data comes from `get_connector_credential_pairs_for_user()` (the same function the existing `/api/build/connectors` endpoint uses).
- For each accessible source, render: source identifier (matching the `--source` flag values), display name, and a one-line description of what's in it.
- For sources with meaningful sub-scopes (Slack channels, Linear teams), include a few examples.
- The list is a snapshot at session creation — not refreshed mid-session. Connector changes take effect on the next session.
- If the user has no connected sources, the skill still renders but the source list says so explicitly. The agent should not hallucinate sources.

> **Implementation note.** Source descriptions reuse the existing `DocumentSourceDescription` dict in `configs/constants.py` (with improved wording where needed) rather than defining a duplicate `SOURCE_DESCRIPTIONS` dict. This keeps source descriptions in one place across the codebase.

#### R4.5: Decommission file sync and rework user library delivery

Remove the legacy `files/` corpus sync infrastructure (search replaces it) and replace the file-sync sidecar with a lightweight user library sync mechanism.

> **Design decision.** See [4-craft-search-proposal.md](4-craft-search-proposal.md) §3 for the full rationale on user library delivery after sidecar removal.

> **Implementation note.** This is split across two PRs. **PR 3 is removal-only** (~1500 lines deleted) — it deletes the old file sync infrastructure after PR 2 (search tool wiring) is verified end-to-end. PR 2 is purely additive — the old file-based knowledge code (`CONNECTOR_INFO`, `build_knowledge_sources_section()`, `{{KNOWLEDGE_SOURCES_SECTION}}` placeholder handling, `generate_agents_md.py`) stays as dead code in PR 2. PR 3 removes it. **PR 4 is the user library rework** — net new code adding the shared volume, kubectl exec sync, and Celery task for user library delivery. This split keeps PR 3 a clean deletion pass and isolates the new functionality in PR 4.

**File sync removal (PR 3 — pure deletion):**
- Remove the `files/` directory from sandbox workspace setup — no more symlink to persistent document storage or demo data.
- Remove the S3 file-sync sidecar container (`aws s3 sync` at pod start). Search replaces connector document access entirely.
- Remove `build_knowledge_sources_section()`, the `{{KNOWLEDGE_SOURCES_SECTION}}` placeholder from `AGENTS.template.md`, `generate_agents_md.py` from the sandbox image, and the `CONNECTOR_INFO` dict.
- Remove `/workspace/files` and `/workspace/demo_data` allowlist rules from `opencode_config.py`.
- Remove `sync_files()` methods, `sync_sandbox_files` Celery task, `_get_disabled_user_library_paths()`, file symlink helpers, demo data, and the connector document write path from `PersistentDocumentWriter`.
- Update `AGENTS.template.md` to point the agent at the `company-search` skill as the only path to company knowledge. Remove references to `files/`, `find`, `grep` over company data, JSON document format, etc.

**User library rework (PR 4 — net new code):**

User library files (spreadsheets, PDFs, etc.) are raw binaries the agent opens directly with Python libraries — search can't replace them. They still need direct file access.

Replace the sidecar with a shared `/workspace/user_library/` directory at the pod level. Sync via one-shot `kubectl exec` (running `aws s3 sync`) triggered at:
- **Session setup/resume** — populates the directory, catching files uploaded while the pod was sleeping.
- **After each upload** — a Celery task fires a kubectl exec to sync the new file immediately.

Sessions access files at `/workspace/user_library/` directly — it's a pod-level shared directory, no per-session symlink needed. The sync is idempotent (`aws s3 sync` compares checksums). If the pod is evicted mid-sync, the next sync recovers cleanly.

**PersistentDocumentWriter (PR 3):** Remove the connector document write path (`write_documents()`, `serialize_document()`, path builder helpers). Keep `write_raw_file()`, `delete_raw_file()`, and the `get_persistent_document_writer()` factory — these are still used for raw user library file writes to S3. `SANDBOX_S3_BUCKET` stays for the same reason.

- **Preserve `attachments/`** — user-uploaded session files are still read via normal file operations and are not part of this removal.

#### R4.6: Validation at session start

Before the agent begins working, verify the search tool is functional:

- After injecting the PAT and bundling the CLI, run `onyx-cli validate-config` inside the sandbox as a health check.
- If validation fails (PAT invalid, backend unreachable, search endpoint not available), the session should surface a clear error rather than letting the agent discover the tool is broken mid-task.
- This uses the capability discovery from Part 1 (R1.6).

#### R4.7: Demo data removal

The `files/` infrastructure is the only delivery mechanism for demo data. Removing file sync removes demo data access. Demo data (`demo_data.zip` in the Docker image, `/workspace/demo_data/` directory, demo-data symlink path) is explicitly removed as part of the file sync decommission in R4.5.

### Key Challenges

- **Internal network URL**: The sandbox must reach the Onyx backend via the internal Kube service URL, not the public nginx URL. `ONYX_SERVER_URL` must be set to an address reachable from inside the sandbox via `SANDBOX_API_SERVER_URL` config.
- **Source list quality**: The one-line descriptions of what's in each source are critical for agent search quality. If the agent doesn't know that "google_drive" contains "engineering specs and product docs," it can't formulate good queries. Resolved by reusing the existing `DocumentSourceDescription` dict in `configs/constants.py` (with improved wording) — no new source metadata system needed.
- **User library sync for non-K8s**: The shared volume + kubectl exec approach is K8s-native. How user library file delivery works for Docker Compose setups needs resolution before Craft ships on non-K8s infrastructure.
- **Transition from file sync**: Existing Craft sessions (if any are active during deploy) will lose access to `files/`. Backwards compatibility is not a constraint — breaking active sessions is acceptable. The implementation uses stacked PRs where PR 2 (search tool wiring) is purely additive — no old code removed. The legacy file-based knowledge code (`CONNECTOR_INFO`, `build_knowledge_sources_section`, `{{KNOWLEDGE_SOURCES_SECTION}}` placeholder handling) stays as dead code in PR 2, cleaned up in PR 3 (pure deletion). PR 4 adds the new user library delivery mechanism (shared volume + kubectl exec sync).
- **Decoupled rendering**: The dynamic skill rendering (`render_company_search_skill()` + `write_sandbox_file()`) is deliberately decoupled from the sandbox manager interface. This avoids threading new parameters through `setup_session_workspace()` and `restore_snapshot()`, keeping the manager abstraction clean. The orchestration lives in `SessionManager.push_dynamic_skills()`, which catches all exceptions and logs a warning so failures don't block session setup.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Testing Strategy

Each part owns its own tests (detailed in part-specific implementation plans), but the end-to-end story spans all four:

- **Unit tests**: Part 1 (TTY detection, output formatting), Part 2 (auth dependency, filter validation)
- **External dependency unit tests**: Part 2 (search endpoint against real Vespa + Postgres — the bulk of the value), Part 4 (PAT lifecycle, SKILL.md rendering)
- **Integration tests**: Part 4 (provision a Craft session, verify the agent can call `onyx-cli search` and get results, verify cross-tenant isolation)
- **Manual smoke**: Run a real Craft session, watch the agent use `onyx-cli search`, compare results to chat search for the same query

### Security Boundaries

- The sandbox receives a per-user PAT with a 30-day expiry. The raw token is stored encrypted at rest on the `Sandbox` row (using `EncryptedString`) and injected as a pod-level env var. When the egress proxy ships, the sandbox will no longer see the raw token at all.
- The CLI config file is not created inside the sandbox. Configuration is env-var-only.
- The search API enforces the same ACL path as chat search. Cross-tenant leakage is tested.
- PATs are stored hashed in the `personal_access_token` table. The raw token additionally exists encrypted on the `Sandbox` row (for re-injection) and in the pod environment.
- PAT scopes are out of scope for this project; they will be addressed by the Permissions system. Craft PATs currently have the same permissions as the user.

### Repo Conventions

All parts follow the conventions in CLAUDE.md:
- `OnyxError` (not `HTTPException`) for all API errors
- Typed FastAPI returns (no `response_model=`)
- DB operations under `backend/onyx/db/`
- Celery tasks with `@shared_task` and `expires=`
- Strict typing in both Python and TypeScript
